    <p class="textbody">Looks like things are loading slower than a dial-up modem in 1998. Don't worry, it's probably not your fault (entirely). Maybe:
        <ul>
            <li>Your internet is having a nap.</li>
            <li>My website is having a performance review... and failing miserably.</li>
            <li>There's a tiny gremlin living in your computer causing trouble.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Whatever the reason, don't fret! You can <a class="link" href="pages\home.html">click here</a> to blast past this message (or just wait patiently, I won't judge).</p>
