                So, last Tuesday, August 13 marked the beginning of my journey as a college student, and it was, well, okay-ish :pepecringe.webp:. Okay, hear me out: new people, new teachers, but the vibe was still eerily reminiscent of senior high school.<br><br>
                
                <b>Same Old Routine</b><br><br>
                It felt like the first day of senior high all over again. Same old orientation fluff, different faces. Maybe it’s because we’re still in the orientation phase this week. No mind-bending algorithms or epic coding challenges yet—just a lot of “Welcome to the program” speeches and "Introduce yourself" stuffs. Can’t wait for the actual lectures and activities, but judging by yesterday, I’m bracing myself for the same old routine with a different coat of paint :clown.gif:.<br><br>
                
                <b>The Schedule Shuffle</b><br><br>
                Oh, and my schedule? It’s a mix of the exciting and the exhausting. Saturdays are now reserved for full-day classes. Yep, That’s right—my weekends, once a sanctuary of relaxation and freedom, are now dedicated to lectures and coding. On the bright side, that’s the only day I’ll need to set an early alarm since most of my other classes at weekdays starts in the afternoon, around 3 or 4 PM. Also, did i mention that I get two weekdays off in exchange of the Saturday classes? Yeah. Mondays will never be the same again :pedrolaughcry.gif:.<br><br>
                
                <b>Hybrid Learning: The New Normal</b><br><br>
                Our learning modality is another curveball—alternate on-site and online classes. This means if this week is on-site, next week will be virtual, unless otherwise directed by the professor. It’s like a high-stakes game of “Where in the World is My Class Today?” Keeps things interesting, I suppose :cringe_office63.webp:, but it also means I’ll need to be flexible and keep track of where I need to be and when.<br><br>
                
                <b>Adjusting to Independence</b><br><br>
                One thing that threw me off was the lack of an adviser. Unlike before, where we had a go-to person for guidance, now we’re basically on our own. We’re now expected to find our rooms and manage everything ourselves. It’s a bit of a shift from the structured support we were used to, and it's definitely new to me.<br><br>
                
                So, here’s to the beginning of what I hope will eventually be an exciting college journey. If the first week was anything to go by, I’m expecting the real fun to start once we dive into the actual coursework. Until then, here’s to my first week of college :peepolove.webp:.</p>
