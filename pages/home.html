            <p class="header">What is Project jrwnnnn_?</p>
            <p class="textbody">First off, believe it or not, despite the website name, my real name is Jerwin. Shocking, right? I'm a computer science student here in the Philippines, and I've been coding since the ripe old age of (wait for it) 14. My first language? HTML, the basic building blocks of the internet  (think blinking text and questionable color schemes). Now I'm tackling Java and Python, because frankly, web development is about as exciting as watching paint dry. When I'm not meticulously crafting lines of code, you can find me strategically demolishing virtual enemies, listening to good <a class="egg" href="side_eggs/music.html">music</a>, trying to convince my pet dog to take over the world (spoiler alert, he's not very interested) or perfecting the art of the ceiling stare. The crazy part? I manage to ace my classes while being this gloriously lazy. Don't worry though, I'm not here to brag (okay, maybe a little). <br>
            <br>
            Now, <yellow>Project jrwnnnn_ </yellow>(don't forget the all-important underscore), also known as Project J21 for those who struggle with remembering four n's in a row, crash-landed onto the internet on May 1st, 2024. Fueled by the overwhelming urge to avoid doing actual work (because let's be honest, staring at the ceiling is an art form), inspiration struck with the force of a rogue sock launched across the room. Clearly, my creations deserved more than just boring file names. I'll also be using this website to share some insights, maybe even some code (gasp!), and definitely track the progress of my stellar projects. Thus, with this website as our launchpad, <yellow> Project jrwnnnn_</yellow> blasts off into the great unknown!</p>
